# Leap

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```text
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leap
year, but 2000 is.

If your language provides a method in the standard library that does
this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Notes

Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to
learn!

For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year
phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

To run the code in this exercise, you will only need to have [CommandBox CLI installed](https://ortus.gitbooks.io/commandbox-documentation/content/setup/installation.html).  This binary runs CFML code from the command line.

To run the tests, `cd` into the exercise folder and run the following:

```bash 
box task run TestRunner
# Or start up a test watcher that will rerun when files change
box task run TestRunner --:watcher
```

The tests leverage a library called TestBox which supports xUnit and BDD style of testing.  All test suites will be written in the [BDD style](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com/content/primers/bdd/specs.html) which uses closures to define test specs.  You won't need to worry about installing TestBox.  The CLI test runner will take care of that for you.  You just need to be connected to the internet the first time you run it.  You can read more about it here:
