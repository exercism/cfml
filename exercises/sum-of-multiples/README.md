# Sum Of Multiples

Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

To run the code in this exercise, you will only need to have [CommandBox CLI installed](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/setup/installation).  This binary runs CFML code from the command line.

To run the tests, `cd` into the exercise folder and run the following:

```bash 
box task run TestRunner
# Or start up a test watcher that will rerun when files change
box task run TestRunner --:watcher
```

The tests leverage a library called TestBox which supports xUnit and BDD style of testing.  All test suites will be written in the [BDD style](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com/content/primers/bdd/specs.html) which uses closures to define test specs.  You won't need to worry about installing TestBox.  The CLI test runner will take care of that for you.  You just need to be connected to the internet the first time you run it.
