# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

Bob's conversational partner is a purist when it comes to written communication and always follows normal rules regarding sentence punctuation in English.

To run the code in this exercise, you will only need to have [CommandBox CLI installed](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/setup/installation).  This binary runs CFML code from the command line.

To run the tests, `cd` into the exercise folder and run the following:

```bash 
box task run TestRunner
# Or start up a test watcher that will rerun when files change
box task run TestRunner --:watcher
```

The tests leverage a library called TestBox which supports xUnit and BDD style of testing.  All test suites will be written in the [BDD style](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com/content/primers/bdd/specs.html) which uses closures to define test specs.  You won't need to worry about installing TestBox.  The CLI test runner will take care of that for you.  You just need to be connected to the internet the first time you run it.  You can read more about it here:
