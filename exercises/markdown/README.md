# Markdown

Refactor a Markdown parser.

The markdown exercise is a refactoring exercise. There is code that parses a
given string with [Markdown
syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and returns the
associated HTML for that string. Even though this code is confusingly written
and hard to follow, somehow it works and all the tests are passing! Your
challenge is to re-write this code to make it easier to read and maintain
while still making sure that all the tests keep passing.

It would be helpful if you made notes of what you did in your refactoring in
comments so reviewers can see that, but it isn't strictly necessary. The most
important thing is to make the code better!

To run the code in this exercise, you will only need to have [CommandBox CLI installed](https://ortus.gitbooks.io/commandbox-documentation/content/setup/installation.html).  This binary runs CFML code from the command line.

To run the tests, `cd` into the exercise folder and run the following:

```bash 
box task run TestRunner
# Or start up a test watcher that will rerun when files change
box task run TestRunner --:watcher
```

The tests leverage a library called TestBox which supports xUnit and BDD style of testing.  All test suites will be written in the [BDD style](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com/content/primers/bdd/specs.html) which uses closures to define test specs.  You won't need to worry about installing TestBox.  The CLI test runner will take care of that for you.  You just need to be connected to the internet the first time you run it.
